The one-page website's JavaScript interaction is intended to improve user experience when a form is submitted. It records the form's submission event using an event listener and the ID "deduction-form." The script extracts the values submitted by the user for a variety of form fields, such as name, staff number, contact information, email, monthly salary, contribution type, start and end dates, and the selected Kulliyyah, by stopping the default form submission process. Then, using the information gathered from the form, it creates a customized confirmation message and shows it to the user in an alert window. Instant feedback is given to users throughout this contact, confirming that their form submission was successful and enhancing their overall satisfaction.
